# Simple Quiz 2
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate an iterative development process of a quiz programme from pseudocode to web-ready. Go to the commit history and investigate the code from bottom up. 

In the commit history, view the commit with message "Pseudocode for quiz with 2 players and 4 questions". It starts with pure pseudocode. Further commits then include javascript (purely using console). 

After a series of refactoring, we then convert the console code to be web-enabled. This takes two primary step. One retains the procedural logic, and the second is event-driven (ie. uses event listeners for 'click').
